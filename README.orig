rtf2html - a RTF to HTML conversion program

This is the first cut at a RTF to HTML converter. It has several limitations
that users should be aware of. First, unless you want to make some changes
to tables within the source, you need to use the style sheet that is
defined in Sample.rtf to format your Word documents. It's easiest to just
start with Sample.rtf as your basic document and cut out what you don't
need.

rtf2html is dependent on the style numbers in the style sheet matching those
in the conversion table in the code. This is an UGLY hack, but I really 
didn't want to parse the style sheet. Hey, it's free.

To build the code, type "make". This code should build on anything with a
C compiler. It was written on a Mac using Think C and moved to Unix with
no changes.
